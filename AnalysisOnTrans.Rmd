## R Markdown
First load the data, then convert the incorrect data to factors, such as am

```{r setup}
data(mtcars)
mtcars$am<-as.factor(mtcars$am)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
